## Coding task solving tips
This tips will help you on real interview, but it would be even better if you start following them during your preparation.

+ Ask clarifying questions: memory, speed limitations; what we have in input, output. Make sure that you understand the task fully before making proposals of solutions.
+ State all your assumptions and confirm them with the interviewer. Make sure they are based on facts & logic.
+ Think out loud, do not be silent
+ Provide sample data
+ Present an optimal solution
+ Get approval of your idea before implementation. Your goal to find the most optimal solution.
+ In case if you have a brute force solution first, you could mention that this is the first that came to your mind.
+ Think out loud, do not be silent
+ Provide complexity of your solution, describe how you calculate it
+ Ask questions during coding if you have them
+ Add unit tests (at least one)
+ Make a review of your code after finishing coding: add comments, make necessary optimizations, make sure that you do not have boilerplates, unused variables

## Coding tasks
You should solve the following tasks and upload code to your repository. Unit tests should be written for each task.
