Design and create a fraction class. It should be immutable. In this task you have to think about data integrity constraints.  
Besides you should override the Object.GetHashCode method using any hash algorithm and the Object.Equals method.  
Test how it works as a key with Hashtable, Dictionary, and HashSet. 

For this class, it is necessary to define a constructor (numerator, denominator), define the operations of addition, difference, multiplication and division, operation of type conversion from a fraction type to a double type.
