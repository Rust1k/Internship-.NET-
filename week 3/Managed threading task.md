There are 10 (doesn`t matter, might be 5 or 20) dancers in a nightclub

There are three types of music:

- Hardbass
- Latino
- Rock

There are three types of dance moves

- Elbow for Hardbass
- Hips for Latino
- Head for Rock


Before the beginning, the DJ creates some kind of tracklist, which consist of 20 tracks in total(might be 30 or 50 doesn't matter) with each music type in random order

Dancers wait for the beginning of the session, then do proper dance moves for each music type,

When the tracks list ends to play all dancers should go home and the app should ends

The idea of the application:
Write Console app with threads (aka dancers) who dance proper moves (e.g. Console.WriteLine("Elbow dance") for each music track, DJ changes tracks sequentially (10-20 secs for each track), and dancers should know somehow about with type of music plays right now.

Of course, you can use your imagination and different types of approaches
