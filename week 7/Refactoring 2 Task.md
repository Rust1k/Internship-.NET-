### Your Task

Consider the solution in folder TripServiceKata.  
The objective is to test and refactor the legacy TripService class. The end result should be well-crafted code that expresses the domain. You do not need tests for collaborators (right now), you want to test only the logic contained in the TripService class.

### Rules

    - You can’t change any existing code if not covered by tests. You can’t afford to break any existing behavior.
    - The only exception is if you need to change the code to add unit tests, but in this case, just automated refactorings (via IDE) are allowed.
